# üß† IBM Data Science Professional Capstone Project

Welcome to the final capstone project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, proudly completed by me as a culmination of months of hands-on learning and exploration. This project is a reflection of the skills and knowledge I've acquired throughout the certification journey‚Äîranging from data collection and wrangling to exploratory analysis, visualization, model building and presentation.


## üìå Project Overview

This capstone project focuses on solving a real-world data science problem using the end-to-end data science workflow. It involves:

- Data collection and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model building and evaluation
- Visualization of key insights
- Deploying the final solution using appropriate tools

## üí° Objective

To demonstrate the ability to:

- Define and structure a real-world data science problem
- Apply machine learning algorithms effectively
- Communicate findings through compelling visuals and narratives
- Use tools like Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Folium, and Dash/Plotly

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- Python (Jupyter Notebooks)
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Folium (for interactive maps)
- Plotly & Dash (for interactive dashboards)


## üìä Highlights

- Created interactive maps using Folium for geographic data visualization
- Built a dashboard using Dash & Plotly for dynamic user interaction
- Performed machine learning classification using real-world datasets
- Provided actionable insights from exploratory and statistical analysis
